# snow
## FiveM resource for enabling snowy weather (including snow ground cover)
### Usage
This resource is client-side only. No building/transpiling required as it's plain JS. Just place this repository folder in your server's `resources` folder and add `ensure snow` to your `server.cfg` (or call `start snow` in the server commandline or whatever, I'm not your mum)
